# HTML & CSS Codecademy Projects #
This repository contains a collection of projects I've completed using HTML& CSS on Codecademy's Frontend Engineer Career Path. 

In the cases where some code was written by Codecademy to be included in the project (ie: CSS stylesheets while I was only learning HTML) I have commented at the top of the file that the code was not written by me.
