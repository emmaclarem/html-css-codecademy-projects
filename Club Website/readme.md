## About
This is a static website homepage for a recreational club, made as part of Codecademy's Frontend Engineer Career Path. I chose to create a made-up book club called Read'in.

This was a completely solo project, with only rough guidance and no starter code from Codecademy.

## Objective
**From Codecademy:** In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​ Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned.
